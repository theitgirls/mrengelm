        <h2 style="color: white">Scavenger Hunt</h2>
        <p style="color: white">Maddie Engelman / July 20th 2022</p>
        <p style="color: white">Today in class we went on a scavenger hunt around the campus. My group went to the dome, admissions office, i school, cafeteria, and link hall. We asked different faculty how they use data and technology in their job. My favorite interview was with a student named Trevor who has a job working with 3d printers. He showed us the printer and how it worked and at the end we got to keep little syracuse logo's that he printed earlier. I also really enjoyed the interview at the dome and below is an image of me interviewing Pete Sala as he showed us all the new improvments the dome is making on their technology.</p>
