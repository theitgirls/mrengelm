        <h2>Scavenger Hunt</h2>
        <p>Maddie Engelman / July 20th, 2022</p>
        <p>Today in class we went on a scavenger hunt around the campus. My group went to the dome, admissions office, i school, cafeteria, and link hall. We asked different faculty how they use data and technology in their job. My favorite interview was with a student named Trevor who has a job working with 3d printers. He showed us the printer and how it worked and at the end we got to keep little syracuse logo's that he printed earlier. I also really enjoyed the interview at the dome and below is an image of me interviewing Pete Sala as he showed us all the new improvments the dome is making on their technology.</p>

        <h2>Citizen Science</h2>
        <p>Maddie Engelman / July, 21st</p>
        <p> Today in class we learned about citizen science which is when people from all over the world can participate in science experiments at home. Today in class my group had the idea of people from all over the United States sending in photos of cardinals to see where they are most populated. Another example of a possible idea for a citizen science projects is to see where has the cleanest beaches/oceans by having people from all over the world send in photos of their local beaches/oceans. By scientists knowing which beaches are the cleanest they can see what the citizens are doing to keep it so clean and can implement their ways into different places in the world who have dirty beaches/oceans.</p>
