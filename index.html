        <p style="color: white">       
             Hi my name is Maddie Engelman! I am from the suburbs of Chicago and a rising senior at Highland Park High School. I decided to take this class because I want to do something with technology in the future and this program lets me learn about many different topics in tech. I'm not sure what part of technology I want to go into but I am very interested in cybersecurity. Outside of school I enjoy playing tennis, skiing, and hanging out with my friends. With my friends I like to go out to eat and go shopping. My favorite show is Outerbanks and my favorite movie is Just Go With It. I can't wait to get to know everyone!
